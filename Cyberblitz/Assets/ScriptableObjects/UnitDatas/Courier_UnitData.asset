  description: V.I.P and Support class
  story: As the new method of "Deathmatch" was implemented by countries to avoid
    war, regulators quickly realized a flaw. With nothing to lose the duels started
    to get out of hands and every corporation challenged everyone for anything. To
    avoid this, new rules were implemented. Every party needed to provide an executive
    or otherwise important person. The Courier is seen as the only operator of any
    value.
