  description: Versatile operator
  story: The Soldier is the backbone of all kill squads and the most commonly picked
    operator. The combat implants are cheap and average in every aspect but fill
    an important role. The procedure for the combat implants is not as gruesome as
    many of the other implants but death is still expected within 48h.
